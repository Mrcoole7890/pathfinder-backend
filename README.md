# pathfinder-backend

The purpose of this project is take the pathfinder project and serve the data generated to frontend user applications.

While I planned to have the final project built and ready for normal usage. I have opted to only run the backend server out of the IDE. It would problibly be more optimal to run a built and compiled version of the project; however, I feel doing so would only feel exsessive.
